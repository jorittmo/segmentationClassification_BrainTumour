  abstract = {Brain is an important part of human body. Many complex human body functions are controlled by brain. Brain imaging is a widely applicable method for diagnosing many brain abnormalities like brain tumor, stroke, paralysis etc. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a recently emerged method for brain imaging. Two major limitations of brain MR Images are low contrast image and presence of skull region in the image. So before detailed analysis of an image, as a preprocessing stage these two problems must be resolved. In this study we propose a method for MR Image contrast enhancement and skull stripping based on the Morphological image processing technique. The proposed method works on T1, T2 and FLAIR axial images. Experimental results show that the proposed method efficiently works for enhancing and skull removal of brain MR Images.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a medical image integrity verification system to detect and approximate local malevolent image alterations (e.g., removal or addition of lesions) as well as identifying the nature of a global processing an image may have undergone (e.g., lossy compression, filtering, etc.). The proposed integrity analysis process is based on nonsignificant region watermarking with signatures extracted from different pixel blocks of interest, which are compared with the recomputed ones at the verification stage. A set of three signatures is proposed. The first two devoted to detection and modification location are cryptographic hashes and checksums, while the last one is issued from the image moment theory. In this paper, we first show how geometric moments can be used to approximate any local modification by its nearest generalized 2-D Gaussian. We then demonstrate how ratios between original and recomputed geometric moments can be used as image features in a classifier-based strategy in order to determine the nature of a global image processing. Experimental results considering both local and global modifications in MRI and retina images illustrate the overall performances of our approach. With a pixel block signature of about 200 bit long, it is possible to detect, to roughly localize, and to get an idea about the image tamper.},

The segmentation of brain tumor from Magnetic Resonance (MR) images is a vital, but time-consuming task performed by medical experts. In this paper, we have presented an effective brain tumor detection technique based on Neural Network (NN) and our previously designed brain tissue segmentation. This technique hits the target with the aid of the following major steps, which includes: Pre-processing of the brain images., segmentation of pathological tissues (Tumor), normal tissues (White Matter (WM) and Gray Matter (GM)) and fluid (Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF)), extraction of the relevant features from each segmented tissues and classification of the tumor images with NN. As well, the experimental results and analysis is evaluated by means of Quality Rate (QR) with normal and the abnormal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images. The performance of the proposed technique is been validated and compared with the standard evaluation metrics such as sensitivity, specificity and accuracy values for NN, K-NN classification and bayesian classification techniques. The obtained results depicts that the classification results yields better results in NNs when compared with the other techniques.},

  abstract = {Brain tumor segmentation consists of separating the different tumor tissues (solid or active tumor, edema, and necrosis) from normal brain tissues: gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In brain tumor studies, the existence of abnormal tissues may be easily detectable most of the time. However, accurate and reproducible segmentation and characterization of abnormalities are not straightforward. In the past, many researchers in the field of medical imaging and soft computing have made significant survey in the field of brain tumor segmentation. Both semiautomatic and fully automatic methods have been proposed. Clinical acceptance of segmentation techniques has depended on the simplicity of the segmentation, and the degree of user supervision. Interactive or semiautomatic methods are likely to remain dominant in practice for some time, especially in these applications where erroneous interpretations are unacceptable. This article presents an overview of the most relevant brain tumor segmentation methods, conducted after the acquisition of the image. Given the advantages of magnetic resonance imaging over other diagnostic imaging, this survey is focused on MRI brain tumor segmentation. Semiautomatic and fully automatic techniques are emphasized.},

  abstract = {Brain MRI is used to get deeper view of the brain conditions. Skull stripping is a major phase sometimes refers to a pre-process in MRI brain imaging applications which refers to the removal of brain non-cerebral tissues. Various algorithms have been developed to improve the effectiveness of stripping skull from MRI. Morphological algorithms of ``Erosion'' and ``Dilation'' are recursively applied together to remove the skull. Besides the removal of skull, ``erosion'' distorts some cerebral tissues due to the presence of falsebackground. So ``Dilation'' process is applied for the restoration. In this study, we improved the efficiency of stripping skull in MRI using systematic application of ``Erosion'' with AOI (Area of Interest) approach after the detection of false-background. Before applying ``Erosion'', a false back ground is detected. We identified the skull boundary through Dilation and then used scan line algorithm to fill the false background area. Consequently ``Erosion'' algorithm will only erode the AOI, resulting in the stripping of skull without any effect on the other tissues of the brain. Results show that the accuracy rate up to 95\% is obtained and 43\% efficiency is increased as compared to the different morphological techniques used previously.},

Pharmacokinetic models may be fitted to DCE-MRI uptake patterns, enabling biologically relevant interpretations. The aim of our study was to determine whether treatment outcome for 81 patients with locally advanced cervical cancer could be predicted from parameters of the Brix pharmacokinetic model derived from pre-chemoradiotherapy DCE-MRI. First-order statistical features of the Brix parameters were used. In addition, texture analysis of Brix parameter maps was done by constructing gray level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM) from the maps. Clinical factors and first- and second-order features were used as explanatory variables for support vector machine (SVM) classification, with treatment outcome as response. Classification models were validated using leave-one-out cross-model validation. A random value permutation test was used to evaluate model significance. Features derived from first-order statistics could not discriminate between cured and relapsed patients (specificity 0\%-20\%, p-values close to unity). However, second-order GLCM features could significantly predict treatment outcome with accuracies ( 70\%) similar to the clinical factors tumor volume and stage (69\%). The results indicate that the spatial relations within the tumor, quantified by texture features, were more suitable for outcome prediction than first-order features.},

First, noise removal is performed as the preprocessing step on the brain MR images. Texture features are extracted from these noise free brain MR images. Next phase of the proposed system is classification that is based on these extracted features. Ensemble based SVM classification is used. More than 99\% accuracy is achieved by the classification phase. After classification, proposed system extracts tumor region from tumorous images using multi-step segmentation. First step is skull removal and brain region extraction. Next step is separating tumor region from normal brain cells using FCM clustering. Results of the proposed technique show that tumor region is extracted quite accurately.

Owing to its ability of learning the nonlinear distribution of the tumor data without using any prior knowledge, one-class support vector machines (SVMs) have been applied in tumor detection. The conventional one-class SVMs, however, assume that each feature of a sample has the same importance degree for the classification result, which is not necessarily true in real applications. In addition, the parameters of one-class SVM and its kernel function also affect the classification result. In this study, immune algorithm (IA) was introduced in searching for the optimal feature weights and the parameters simultaneously. One-class immune feature weighted SVM (IFWSVM) was proposed to detect tumors in MR images. Theoretical analysis and experimental results showed that one-class IFWSVM has better performance than conventional one-class SVM.},

We propose a robust method based on the temporal sequence of textural change and wavelet transform for pixel-by-pixel classification. We first segment the breast region using an active contour model. We then compute textural change on pixel blocks. We apply a three-scale discrete wavelet transform on the texture temporal sequence to further extract frequency features. We employ a progressive feature selection scheme and a committee of support vector machines for the classification. We trained the system on ten cases and tested it on eight independent test cases. Receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) analysis shows that the texture temporal sequence (Az: 0.966 and 0.949 in training and test) is much more effective than the intensity sequence (Az: 0.871 and 0.868 in training and test).

  abstract = {Purpose Gliomas are the most common and aggressive type of brain tumors due to their infiltrative nature and rapid progression. The process of distinguishing tumor boundaries from healthy cells is still a challenging task in the clinical routine. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI modality can provide the physician with information about tumor infiltration. Therefore, this paper proposes a new generic deep learning architecture, namely DeepSeg, for fully automated detection and segmentation of the brain lesion using FLAIR MRI data. Methods The developed DeepSeg is a modular decoupling framework. It consists of two connected core parts based on an encoding and decoding relationship. The encoder part is a convolutional neural network (CNN) responsible for spatial information extraction. The resulting semantic map is inserted into the decoder part to get the full-resolution probability map. Based on modified U-Net architecture, different CNN models such as residual neural network (ResNet), dense convolutional network (DenseNet), and NASNet have been utilized in this study. Results The proposed deep learning architectures have been successfully tested and evaluated on-line based on MRI datasets of brain tumor segmentation (BraTS 2019) challenge, including s336 cases as training data and 125 cases for validation data. The dice and Hausdorff distance scores of obtained segmentation results are about 0.81 to 0.84 and 9.8 to 19.7 correspondingly. Conclusion This study showed successful feasibility and comparative performance of applying different deep learning models in a new DeepSeg framework for automated brain tumor segmentation in FLAIR MR images.

  abstract = {The segmentation, detection, and extraction of infected tumor area from magnetic resonance (MR) images are a primary concern but a tedious and time taking task performed by radiologists or clinical experts, and their accuracy depends on their experience only. So, the use of computer aided technology becomes very necessary to overcome these limitations. In this study, to improve the performance and reduce the complexity involves in the medical image segmentation process, we have investigated Berkeley wavelet transformation (BWT) based brain tumor segmentation. Furthermore, to improve the accuracy and quality rate of the support vector machine (SVM) based classifier, relevant features are extracted from each segmented tissue. The experimental results of proposed technique have been evaluated and validated for performance and quality analysis on magnetic resonance brain images, based on accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and dice similarity index coefficient. The experimental results achieved 96.51\% accuracy, 94.2\% specificity, and 97.72\% sensitivity, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed technique for identifying normal and abnormal tissues from brain MR images. The experimental results also obtained an average of 0.82 dice similarity index coefficient, which indicates better overlap between the automated (machines) extracted tumor region with manually extracted tumor region by radiologists. The simulation results prove the significance in terms of quality parameters and accuracy in comparison to state-of-the-art techniques.},
